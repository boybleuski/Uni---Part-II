To run the program:

MAZE GENERATOR
 - 	Open the command promptand set the source to the folder containing the files. On Windows, this can be done by holding Shift+Ctrl and right-	clicking in the folder, then pressing "Open Windows PowerShell here".
 - 	In the window, type 'java MazeGenerator <width> <height> <filename>' (without the quotation marks), where <width> and <height> are integers and <filename> is the name of a file as a string.  
 - 	For example, 'java MazeGenerator 5 6 maze.dat' will generate a maze with a width of 5 and a height of 6, and will output it to a file named 'maze.dat'
 -	The file name must be a valid text file. Files will invalid extensions will still be generated, but they cannot be read.  .txt, .dat and .doc are examples of valid file types, and a file with no extension can also be read.
 -	Do not attempt to generate a 1-cell maze (width = 1 and height = 1). This will result in errors, as well as being pointless.
