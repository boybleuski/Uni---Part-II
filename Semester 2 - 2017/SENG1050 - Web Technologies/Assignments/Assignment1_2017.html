          The objectives of this assignment are to test your ability to create
          XML documents that contain well-defined information and to develop web pages using HTML with CSS. This assignment will
          be developed further in Assignment 2.
        </p>


        <div class="warning">

          <h3 id="generated" >Warning - HTML, XML, CSS Generating Tools</h3>

          <p>
            You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use tools which
            <em>generate</em> HTML, XML, XSLT or CSS code from a visual
            representation. This includes DreamWeaver,
            Microsoft Frontpage, Saving to HTML from MS Word, etc.
            You must write all code yourself in a plain-text
            editor such as NotePad.
            Any assignments that use code generated from a tool will be given
            <strong>ZERO</strong>.
          </p>

        <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

        <p>
			The NewcastleAd company has invited you, as a promising student of their partner 
			institution the University of Newcastle with web communication skills, 
			to develop a web site, <em>Online Food Delivery</em>,  that advertises the restaurants who have adopted online 
			ordering and delivery system. This service is well received by those who use it but currently there is no place to advertise the system.  		
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether the restaurants are opening first time or the restaurants have been many years, they need advertising
			to be successful businesses. Your job is to help them! 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Your task to present the restaurants as appealingly as possible on the web. 
			This will involve, </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Creating an <a href="#template">XML template</a> and <a href="#dtd">DTD</a> </li>
          <li>Creating two <a href="#objects">XML documents</a></li>
          <li>Developing <a href="#web">a home page</a> for the advertisement.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Details of all these requirements are given below.
        </p>

        <hr />

		<h2 id="template">XML template</h2>
        <p>
			The template will be a <strong>valid</strong> XML file. The important parts here are the tags
			(the organization of the data), <strong>not the actual data</strong> about any restaurants. 
			However, you will need to include some arbitrary data to allow your page to be validated. 
			For example, if the <em>default</em> of an attribute is #REQUIRED, 
			the attribute needs a value otherwise it will not be validated.
		</p>

        <h3> XML Specification</h3>
        <p>
			The document should be able to store as many restaurants as required, 
			and all the restaurants in the <em>Online Food Delivery</em> website should belong to a particular cuisine. 
			The cuisine could be &apos;Asian&apos;, &apos;BBQ &amp; Grill&apos;, &apos;Burgers&apos;, 
			&apos;Indian&apos;, &apos;Italian&apos; or &apos;Thai&apos;. 
			You will decide the tags that you wish to use to describe the restaurants, 
			but you should at least have tags for the following items …. 
		</p> 

        <ul>
			<li>Cuisine type (one only)</li>
            <li>Restaurant name (one only)</li>
			<li>Restaurant logo (zero or one)</li>
			<li>Restaurant picture or Food picture (one or more)</li>
			<li>URL (one only)</li>
			<li>Address (one only)</li>
			<li>Phone number (one or more)</li>
			<li>Opening hours (one only)</li>
			<li>Delivery (one only)
				<ul>
					<li>Mininum price</li>
					<li>Delivery Fee</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Restaurant description</li>	
							
		</ul>
        
		<p>
			At least 1 tag must have an attribute. If you  include only the items mentioned above you will 
			<strong>NOT</strong> get full marks for the assignment. Please add at least 3 more tags that 
			make your template different from others.
		</p>
		
        <hr />

        <h2 id="dtd">DTD</h2>

        <p>
          You will also need to write a DTD for your XML. Generally, it is your choice whether the DTD 
		  is internal or external, however, for the SENG1050 assignment, you should make 
		  the DTD internal because it is easier to validate your XML and DTD. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Your DTD will need to describe all the tags and attributes that you used in your XML. 
		  It will also be important to use optional modifiers (+, *, ?) to indicate how many 
		  instances of each tag are allowed. 
        </p>
		<p>
			In your DTD, define at least one entity (&lt;!ENTITY&gt;) and use it in the XML document.
		</p>


        <hr>
		<h2 id="objects">XML documents</h2>

        <p>
          Once you have your XML template with DTD, you will need to make 2 separate XML documents.
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li> choose two cuisines and</li>
			<li> write one XML document for each cuisine.</li>
			<li> each XML document should contain <strong>data</strong> for 3 restaurants.</li>
			<li> each XML document should contain the internal DTD at the top of the document.</li>
			<li> the DTDs in 2 XML documents should be the same.</li>
			<li> the 2 XML documents <strong>MUST</strong> have the same tags and DTD as the XML template.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<hr />
		
	<h2 id="web">Homepage development</h2>
		<p>
		You will develop the <em>Online Food Delivery</em> Homepage. You need to create the following files:<br><be>
	
		</be></p><ul>

		<li><a href="#css">Cascading Style Sheet (style.css)</a></li>

          <h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>
         <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it was your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" other people's work in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately.
            Failure to do so will cause you to lose marks for the assignment.
            An assignment that consists largely of work copied from elsewhere
            will receive very low (zero) marks, and may be reported to the
            School for suspicion of plagiarism.
          </p>

          <span class="file"><strong>.zip</strong></span> archive containing every files and
          submit it using the Web form in the Assignment 1 area.
          The <span class="file">.zip</span> archive should be named
          <span class="file">cXXXXXXX.zip</span> archive where
          <span class="file">XXXXXXX</span> is replaced by
          <strong>your</strong> student id.

          Failure to submit correctly is not of itself a sufficient reason
          to apply for Adverse Circumstances on the assignment.
