		<p> <img src="calculator.PNG" alt="calculator"/> </p>	
		<p> Please add ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, and DIVISION functions.</p>
	

		        <h2 id="js">Task 2 - Understand and write a form validation script</h2>

		<p> <img src="form.png" alt="forms"/> </p>		
		
	<p> Download <code><a href="formValidation.html"> formValidation.html</a> </code>from Blackboard.

</P>	
    <ol>		

	<li> Write a function called <code>checkNameYear()</code> that, in addition to validating that the name field is filled out, 
	also validates that the birth year is 4 digits long. Hint: you may need to use a cascading if in <code>checkNameYear()</code>.</li>

	<li> Write a JavaScript expression to validate that not more than two of the checkboxes were selected from 
	     <code>easyform</code>.</li>
	

	<li>Write a JavaScript expression to validate that one and only one of the checkboxes was selected from 
	    <code>easyform</code>.
	In English, the test of the if is broken into two parts: if (A OR B) where A is "if no boxes are checked at all" 
	and B is "if more than 1 box is checked". If either of these cases is true, then it is not the case that one and 
	only one box was checked, so we issue and alert and return false. Otherwise (else), 
	we thank the user and return true.
	
	</li>
	

	</ol>

        <h2 id="jstools">Task 3 - Learning new, useful JavaScript tools</h2>

        <ul>
		<li><strong>Check that a textbox contains only numerical data.</strong> Use a form to construct a textbox (at least 10 characters) and write a JavaScript function to check that the input is numerical. In your function you can make use of the following variable <br /> <pre><code>var pattern = /^-?\d+(\.\d+)?$/;</code></pre><br />
The interpretation is;<br />
<table><tbody><tr>
<td><code>^-?</code></td><td>	At the start of the string you may have a minus sign</td></tr><tr>
<td><code>\d+</code></td><td>	Then you will have one or more digits</td></tr><tr>
<td><code>(\.\d+)?</code></td><td> Then, optionally, a decimal point followed by one or more digits</td></tr><tr>
<td><code>$</code></td><td>	Then the string ends. </td></tr></tbody></table>
To test, use <code>var a = pattern.test(getElementById("id").value)</code> and check to see if <code>a</code> contains "true" or "false".</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Calculate the length of a text string.</strong> From the lecture notes, make use of 
<code>document.getElementById("id").value.length</code>. Make sure your textbox has an identifier ("id"). Use <code>document.write()</code> to print out the length of the text string.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Calculate the position of a character within a string.</strong> JavaScript's <code>indexOf</code> allows us to determine the position of a character (or even a substring) within a string of text. For example <br />
<pre><code> var a = "1 1 was a racehorse, 2 2 was 1 2. 1 1 1 1 race 1 day, 2 2 1 1 2.";<br />
 var b = a.indexOf("w");</code></pre><br />
The value of the variable <code>b</code> is now 4 (remember JavaScript begins counting from 0).<br />
Choose a character from the textbox with identity "id" above and use <code>indexOf</code> to determine its position.</li>
	</ul>

        <h2 id="validform">Task 4 - Implement a form validation script</h2>

	Much time and bandwidth can be saved by performing simple checks on a form at the client side before the form is transmitted. The exercises in Task 2 allow for a simple form validation script.
        <ol>
          <li>Construct a simple HTML form with input boxes for name, password, email address and telephone number.</li>
          <li>Make sure the password is at least 6 characters long. You will need to use an <code>if</code> statement to determine if the password in insufficient and, if so, you may like to notify the reader by means of an <code>alert</code> box.</li>
          <li>Make sure the box for telephone number contains only integers. (You do not need to check for negative numbers or decimals).</li>
          <li>Make sure the email address contains the "@" symbol.</li>
          <li>Consider making the script more sophisticated by allowing "+" and "( )" characters in telephone numbers to allow for international calls or by making sure that a "." appears as a character after "@" in an email address.</li>
        </ol>
