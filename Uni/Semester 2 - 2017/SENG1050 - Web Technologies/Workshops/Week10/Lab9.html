      <h2>Task 1</h2>
      <p>Is there progress? - Both examples could be fixed with an absolute or <br>
      overall progress bar.  The first example could convince the user that their PC has <br>
      locked up, while the second is provides no indication of when the download will conclude.</p>
      <p>I want them all! - The example uses radio buttons disguised as checkboxes for visual<br>
      consistency, but instead causes confusion when a user tries to select mutually-exclusive<br>
      options.  This could be fixed by greying out options when their mutually-exclusive<br>
      counterparts are selected.</p>
      <p>Fun with scrolling! - The first example uses nested scrollbars, and can be fixed by<br>
      expanding the inner window so that the inner scrollbar is unneccessary.  The second combines<br>
      horizontal and vertical bars, and can be fixed by listing all of the options vertically, or by<br>
      extending the window horizontally so that all information appears on the screen.</p>
      <p>More tabs please! - The first example has a ridiculous amount of tabs clogging the interface.<br>
      Drop-down menus would be a better option here.  Also, remove the unnecessary and distracting graphics.</p>
      <p>Helpful tips! - Providing help for the user is important, but it must be solicited.<br>
      Excessive and/or lengthy rollover descriptions will make the page frustrating to navigate.</p>
      <p>Green good - red bad! - Using colour should never be used in buttons to suggest choice.<br>
      Plain neutral colours do not suggest that one option is preferred over another (in the provided example, <br>
      wiping all the records is green/affirmative, but this could be a permanent and costly mistake.)
