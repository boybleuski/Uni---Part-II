Standish Group study
    - 1994: approx. 16% of project completed on time, 31% failed projects
    - 2004: approx. 29% of project completed on time, 18% failed projects
    - 2009: failure rates increased

Project Life Cycle
    - Defining: objectives, specifications, responsibilities and teams.
    - Planning: task delegation, planning and scheduling, budget and quality.
    - Executing: physical and mental work, adjusting forecasts based on measures, changes based on revisions.
    - Closing: Product delivery, resource deployment and post-project review.

Compression of the Product Life Cycle
    - Knowledge Explosion: Ever-increasing product complexity.
    - Triple Bottom Line (Planet, People, Profit): Instead of just making money, ecological and sociological concerns.
    - Corporate Downsizing: Outsourcing and reduction of middle management.
    - Increased Customer Focus: Customers now require customised goods and services.
    - Small Projects Represent Big Problems

Sociocultural Dimensions: Leadership, Problem solving, Teamwork, Negotiation, Politics, Customer expectations
Technical Dimensions: Scope, WBS, Schedules, Resource allocation, Baseline budgets, Status reports

Strategic Management
    - Identify the main focus of the business - markets to target fo maximum return, efficiency and budget
    - Avoid narrowing focus on too small or immediate a customer base, do not complicate a project with technology when a simple solution works, and do not aim for perfection when only the project team cares about perfection.
    - Projects should demonstrably add to the company's mission. Explain this in non-technical terms.
    - Major dimensions of strategic management: external and internal.
        - External == Maximise limited resources to remain competitive, and always search for change and opportunity.
        - Internal == manage environmental volatility, organisation culture and responses to projects.

Four Activities of Strategic Management
    1. Review and define organisational mission.
        - What the company wants to become - mission statements.
        - Mission statements are significant and rarely change. Think Apple branching out in the late 90s.
        - "Where" the company is going.
    2. Set long-range goals and objectives.
        - Convert mission into measurable realistic objectives.
        - "When" the company will get there.
    3. Analyse and formulate strategies to reach objectives.
        - Evaluate the company's past and objectives, selecting the best.
        - Assess the internal and external environments (SWOT analysis).
        - "What" the company will do to get there.
    4. Implement strategies through projects.
        - Allocate resources (people, funds, skills, etc)
        - Define management, who is best suited for what role.
        - Planning and control systems.
        - Provide motivation.
        - "How" startegies are realised.
Issues
    - IMPLEMENTATION GAP == Problems when upper management formulates startegy and leaves implementation to the others - trust issues, lack of inside knowledge (costs, skills, etc), role confusion, etc.
    - ORGANISATION POLITICS == preferences of people in power, in-fighting and so forth.
    - RESOURCE CONFLICTS AND MULTITASKING == starting and stopping tasks is inefficient and results in delays.

Project Classifications
    - Compliance == must-do || penalties for non-compliance
    - Strategic == future goals || new products, research and development || increase revenue
    - Operational == important maintenance || improve delivery and performance, reduce costs

Selection Criteria
    - Financial
        - Payback model == measures the time until the project is paid back.
            - Payback period (yrs) = Project cost / annual savings
        - NPV (net present value) model == uses minimum desired rate of return to compute net inflow.
            - NPV = Investment + SUM(Net cash flow for period / (1 + minimum return rate)^period index
    - Non-financial
        - Maintain core competencies.
        - Ignore projects with low profit margins.
        - Develop useful core technology.
        - Reduce dependency on external factors, and more.
