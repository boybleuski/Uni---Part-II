		<p>
			The objectives of this exercise are to familiarise you with creating Class diagram in Rational Rose software.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that you should have registered for the lab session which you are
			attending. If you are not registered for a lab, the demonstrators have
			every right to ask you to leave the laboratory room. If you have not
			registered for any lab session, then you should <a href="mailto:joe.ryan@newcastle.edu.au">contact</a> the lecturer as soon as possible.

		<h2 id="usecase">Create Class diagram based on scenario.</h2>

		<h3>Learning objectives</h3>

		<p>
			At the end of this exercise you should be able to produce a fully realised class diagram that satisfies 
			the requirements set out in the scenario.
		</p>
        <br />
		
		<h3> Exercise 1 </h3>
		1. Based on the following scenario, produce a Class diagram including multiplicity.
		<blockquote>
		<p> The system stores information about two things: cars and owners. A car has attributes for make, 
		model, and year. The owner has attributes for name and address. Assume a car must be owned by one 
		owner and an owner can own many card, but an owner might not own any cars (perhaps she just sold 
		them all, but we still want a record of her in the system).</P>
		</blockquote>
		<p>2. Extend the class diagram to include subclasses for sports car, sedan, and minivan with 
		appropriate attributes.</p> 
        <br />
				
		<h3> Exercise 2 - Online shopping</h3>
		Based on the following scenario, produce a class diagram including multiplicity.
		<blockquote>
		<p>Each <b>customer</b> could have some <b>web user</b> identity. Web user could be in several states and could be linked 
		to one <b>shopping cart</b>. 
		Each customer has exactly one <b>account</b>. Account owns shopping cart and orders. Orders are sorted and unique. 
		Each order is linked to none to several <b>payments</b>. </p>
        </blockquote>
		<br />

	    <h3> Exercise 3 </h3>
		Based on the following scenario, produce a Class diagram including multiplicity.
		<blockquote>
		<p> A <u>user</u> can open a new or existing <u>document</u>. <u>Text</u> is <em>entered</em> through a <u>keyboard</u>. 
		A document is made 
		up of several <u>pages</u> and each page is made up of a <u>header</u>, <u>body</u>. and <u>footer</u>. 
		<u>Date</u>, <u>time</u> and <u>page number</u> 
		many be <em>added</em> to header or footer. Document body is made up of <u>sentences</u>, which are themselves made up 
		of <u>words</u> and <u>punctuation characters</u>. Words are made up of <u>letters</u>, <u>digits</u> and/or 
		<u>special characters</u>. 
		<u>Pictures</u> and <u>tables</u>. may be <em>inserted</em> into the document body. Tables are made up of <u>rows</u> 
		and <u>columns</u> and 
		every <u>cell</u> in a table can contain both text and pictures. Users can <em>save</em> or <em>print</em> documents. </P>
		<ul>
		   <li>Nouns (underlined) are either classes or their attributes</li>
		   <li>Verbs (italicized) are class operations</li>
		   <li>Main handled entity: document</li>
		</blockquote>
		<br />

		
		<h3> Exercise 4</h3>
		Based on the following scenario, produce a class diagram.
		<blockquote>
		<p> DownTown Video Rental System</P>
		<p><em>
		DownTown Videos is a chain of 11 video stores scattered throughout a major metropolitan area in the Midwest. The chain started with a single store several years ago and has grown to its present size. Paul Lowes, the owner of the chain, knows that to compete with the national chains will require a state-of-the-art movie rental system. You have been asked to develop the system requirements for the new system. 
		<br /><br />Each store has a stock of movies and video games for rent. It is important to keep track of each movie title to know and to identify its category (classical, drama, comedy, and so on), its rental type (new release, standard), movie rating, and other general information such as movie producer, release date, cost, and so forth. In addition to tracking each title, the business must track each individual copy to note its purchase date, its condition, and its rental status. User functions must be provided to maintain this inventory information. 
		<br /><br />Customers, the lifeblood of the business, are also tracked. DownTown considers each family to be a customer, so special mailings and promotions are offered to each household. For any given customer, several people may be authorized to rent videos and games. The primary contact for each customer can also establish rental parameters for other members of the household. For example, if a parent wants to limit a child&#39;s rental authorization to only PG and PG-13 movies, the system will track that. 
		<br /><br />Each time a movie is rented, the system must keep track of which copies of which movies and games are rented; the rental date and time and the return date and time; and the household and person renting the movie. Each rental is considered to be open until all of the movies and games have been returned. Customers pay for rentals when checking out videos at the store.

		<h3> Exercise 5</h3>
		<p>Based on the following scenario produce a domain class diagram. Please show to your demonstrator to discuss when completed. 
			Please note that your diagram may look very different to others in the class, depending on design decisions that you make.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p> Library System </p>
		<p><em>
		This case is a simplified (initial draft) of a new system for the University Library. Of course, the library system must keep track of books. Information is maintained about both book titles and the individual book copies. Book titles maintain information about title, author, publisher, and catalog number. Individual copies maintain copy number, edition, publication year, ISBN, book status (whether it is on the shelf or loaned out), and date due back in.
		<br /><br />The library also keeps track of patrons to the library. Since it is a university library, there are several types of patrons, each with different privileges. There are faculty patrons, graduate student patrons, and undergraduate student patrons. Basic information about all patrons is name, address, and telephone number. For faculty patrons, additional information is office address and telephone number. For graduate students, information such as graduate program and advisor information is maintained. For undergraduate students program and total credit hours are maintained.
		<br /><br />The library also keeps information about library loans. A library loan is a somewhat abstract object. A loan occurs when a patron approaches the circulation desk with a stack of books to check out. 
		            Over time a patron can have many loans. A loan can have many physical books associated with it. (And a physical book can be on many loans over a period of time. Information about past loans is kept in the database.) 
					So, in this case, it is recommended that an association class be created for loaned books.
		<br /><br />If a book is checked out that a patron wants, he/she can put that title on reserve. This is another class that does not represent a concrete object. Each reservation is for only one title and one patron. Information such as date reserved, priority, and date fulfilled is maintained.
		<br /><br />When it is fulfilled, the system associates it with the loan on which it was checked out.
		<br /><br />Patrons have access to the library information to search for book titles and to see whether a book is available. A patron can also reserve a title if all copies are checked out. When patrons bring books to the circulation desk, a clerk checks out the books on a loan. Clerks also check books in. When books are dropped in the return slot, the clerks check them in.
		<br /><br />Stocking clerks keep track of the arrival of new books.
		<br /><br />The managers in the library have their own activities. They will print out reports of book titles by category. They also like to see (online) all overdue books. When books get damaged or destroyed, they will delete information about book copies. Managers also like to see what books are on reserve.
